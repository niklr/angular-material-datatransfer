angular-material-datatransfer
=========

Demo: https://niklr.github.io/angular-material-datatransfer/

angular-material-datatransfer is a web-based application combining the upload and download of multiple simultaneous files in a unified user interface. 
The application is explicitly designed for modern browsers supporting advanced [`HTML5 File API`](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/) features.

The unified user interface is built on top of Google's [Material Design](https://material.io) implemented by [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) using [Angular](https://angular.io/). Material Design by Google's definition is a visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science.

For multiple simultaneous uploads the open-source library called [Resumable.js](https://github.com/23/resumable.js/) is used.
Resumable.js introduces fault-tolerance into the upload of large files through HTTP. This is done by splitting each file into small chunks. Then, whenever the upload of a chunk fails, uploading is retried until the procedure completes. This allows uploads to automatically resume uploading after a network connection is lost either locally or to the server. Additionally, it allows for users to pause, resume and even recover uploads without losing state because only the currently uploading chunks will be aborted, not the entire upload.

For multiple simultaneous downloads the open-source library called [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) is used.
FileSaver.js implements the `saveAs()` FileSaver interface in browsers that do not natively support it.

## Handling download <a name="handling_download"></a>
The download of a file can be triggered by dispatching a custom event called `github:niklr/angular-material-datatransfer.download-item` on the document object. Data can be passed as detail object with the following properties.
* `filename` The name of the file to be downloaded.
* `url` The URL of the file to be downloaded.
* `size` The size in bytes of the file to be downloaded. 

```js
var eventDetail = { 
  'filename': filename, 
  'url': url, 
  'size': size 
};
var event = new CustomEvent('github:niklr/angular-material-datatransfer.download-item', { 'detail': eventDetail });
document.dispatchEvent(event);
```

## Events <a name="events"></a>
After initialization, it is possible to listen to events initiated by angular-material-datatransfer:

```js
document.addEventListener('github:niklr/angular-material-datatransfer.upload-completed', function (e) { ... });
```

* `github:niklr/angular-material-datatransfer.upload-completed` Indicates that the overall upload has been completed.
* `github:niklr/angular-material-datatransfer.download-completed` Indicates that the overall download has been completed.
* `github:niklr/angular-material-datatransfer.item-added` Indicates that an item has been added. It will be passed a IDatatransferItem as detail payload.
* `github:niklr/angular-material-datatransfer.item-removed` Indicates that an item has been removed. It will be passed a IDatatransferItem as detail payload.
* `github:niklr/angular-material-datatransfer.item-completed` Indicates that an item has been completed.
* `github:niklr/angular-material-datatransfer.items-cleared` Indicates that all items have been cleared.

## Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>
In order to initialize and configure angular-material-datatransfer, a custom event called `github:niklr/angular-material-datatransfer.create` can be dispatched on the document object. The configuration differentiates between `core` and `resumablejs`. Both are described below. 

```js
var config = {
  production: boolean // corresponds to the environment variable (Default: true)
  core: {
    ...
  },
  resumablejs: {
    ...
  }
};
var event = new CustomEvent('github:niklr/angular-material-datatransfer.create', { 'detail': config });
document.dispatchEvent(event);
```

May return [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)-like object with `then()` method for asynchronous id generation. Parameters are the ES `File` object and the event that led to
adding the file. (Default: `null`)
* `maxFiles` Indicates how many files can be uploaded in a single session. Valid values are any positive integer and `undefined` for no limit. (Default: `undefined`)
* `maxFilesErrorCallback(files, errorCount)` A function which displays the *please upload n file(s) at a time* message. (Default: displays an alert box with the message *Please n one file(s) at a time.*)
* `minFileSize` The minimum allowed file size.  (Default: `undefined`)
* `minFileSizeErrorCallback(file, errorCount)` A function which displays an error a selected file is smaller than allowed. (Default: displays an alert for every bad file.)
* `maxFileSize` The maximum allowed file size.  (Default: `undefined`)
* `maxFileSizeErrorCallback(file, errorCount)` A function which displays an error a selected file is larger than allowed. (Default: displays an alert for every bad file.)
* `fileType` The file types allowed to upload. An empty array allow any file type. (Default: `[]`)
* `fileTypeErrorCallback(file, errorCount)` A function which displays an error a selected file has type not allowed. (Default: displays an alert for every bad file.)
* `maxChunkRetries` The maximum number of retries for a chunk before the upload is failed. Valid values are any positive integer and `undefined` for no limit. (Default: `undefined`)
* `chunkRetryInterval` The number of milliseconds to wait before retrying a chunk on a non-permanent error.  Valid values are any positive integer and `undefined` for immediate retry.  (Default: `undefined`)
* `withCredentials` Standard CORS requests do not send or set any cookies by default. In order to include cookies as part of the request, you need to set the `withCredentials` property to true. (Default: `false`)
* `xhrTimeout` The timeout in milliseconds for each request (Default: `0`)

## Server-side setup <a name="server_setup"></a>
Most of the magic happens in the user's browser, but files still need to be reassembled from chunks on the server side. This should be a fairly simple task, which and can be achieved using any web framework or language that is capable of handling file uploads.

To handle the state of upload chunks, a number of extra parameters are sent along with all requests:

* `resumableChunkNumber`: The index of the chunk in the current upload. First chunk is `1` (no base-0 counting here).
* `resumableTotalChunks`: The total number of chunks.
* `resumableChunkSize`: The general chunk size. Using this value and `resumableTotalSize` you can calculate the total number of chunks.
* `resumableCurrentChunkSize`: The current chunk size. Please note that this value might be lower or higher than `resumableChunkSize` for the last chunk of a file.
* `resumableTotalSize`: The total file size.
* `resumableIdentifier`: A unique identifier for the file contained in the request.
* `resumableFilename`: The original file name (since a bug in Firefox results in the file name not being transmitted in chunk multipart posts).
* `resumableRelativePath`: The file's relative path when selecting a directory (defaults to file name in all browsers except Chrome).

You should allow for the same chunk to be uploaded more than once; this isn't standard behaviour, but on an unstable network environment it could happen.

For every request, you can confirm reception in HTTP status codes (can be change through the `permanentErrors` option):

* `200`: The chunk was accepted and correct. No need to re-upload.
* `400`, `404`, `405`, `415`, `501`: The file for which the chunk was uploaded is not supported, cancel the entire upload.
* _Anything else_: Something went wrong, but try reuploading the file.
